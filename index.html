      <h3>Sustainable Sovereignty for Ethereum Classic</h3>
      <p>
        A protocol-native, non-inflationary treasury funded by redirected BASEFEE revenue enables open and decentralized
        support for client maintenance, public goods, and long-term network security — without altering Ethereum
        Classic’s monetary policy, miner rewards, or governance rules. Olympia, defined through ECIPs 1111–1115,
        introduces a modern EIP-1559-style transaction type alongside ETC’s existing formats. Use of this new
        transaction
        type is voluntary: all legacy transactions and contracts continue functioning exactly as they do today. The full
        BASEFEE component is redirected into an immutable, transparent treasury, creating a sustainable on-chain funding
        layer for the ecosystem while all protocol upgrades continue to follow Ethereum Classic’s established
        ECIP-1000 governance process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This funding layer addresses long-standing challenges stemming from Ethereum Classic’s historical reliance on
        centralized entities, volunteer labor, and sporadic donations. Olympia transitions ETC from these fragile
        dependencies to a self-sustaining, sovereign chain that is no longer reliant on any single organization or
        team. By decentralizing critical development funding, Olympia broadens participation to the global EVM
        developer ecosystem, reducing concentration risks and mitigating the centralizing effects of the prior
        donor-and-sponsor model, where control over core development often followed whoever was willing to pay for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Olympia strengthens Ethereum Classic’s commitment to credible neutrality by ensuring the network remains
        resilient against corporate capture, stagnation, and operational decay — enabling ETC to grow as a truly
        decentralized, self-funded Proof-of-Work blockchain.

    <!-- OLYMPIA OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="olympia">
      <h3>Olympia Overview</h3>
      <p>
        For most of its history, Ethereum Classic relied on external sponsors, donor-driven initiatives, and volunteer
        labor to support core development and infrastructure — a fragile and inconsistent funding model for a global
        blockchain. The Olympia Upgrade introduces a <strong>protocol-native, transparent, non-inflationary</strong>
        funding
        layer by adding <strong>BASEFEE</strong> via ECIP-1111 and redirecting that revenue into the immutable on-chain
        Treasury defined in ECIP-1112.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the <strong>only major Proof-of-Work blockchain with native smart contracts</strong>, Ethereum Classic is
        uniquely positioned to deploy a sustainable, on-chain treasury and governance model. While other PoW networks
        depend
        on centralized committees, informal volunteerism, or off-chain grants, ETC can leverage the full expressiveness
        of the EVM — including DAO governance, transparent proposal workflows, cryptographic metadata binding, and
        battle-tested public-goods funding mechanisms pioneered across the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Olympia brings these capabilities to a PoW environment in a way no other chain can: a decentralized,
        programmable, and auditable funding system for core protocol work. Its architecture draws on <strong>best
          practices in
          open governance, audited smart contracts, and empirical evidence</strong> accumulated over nearly a decade of
        EVM-based DAO evolution — while preserving ETC’s fixed monetary policy, Proof-of-Work consensus, and ECIP-1000
        upgrade
        process. Olympia introduces no inflation, no new token, and preserves a governance process that remains open,
        sybil-resistant, and accountable to the Ethereum Classic ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of altering ETC’s monetary policy or block rewards, Olympia redirects value that would be burned on
        other
        EVM chains into a shared on-chain public-goods treasury governed through a modular DAO framework and a
        standardized
        funding proposal process. Olympia advances the community’s original 2016 commitment — expressed in the
        <a href="https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2016-08-13-declaration-of-independence" target="_blank">
          Ethereum Classic Declaration of Independence</a> — that the chain remain sovereign, censorship-resistant, and
        free from third-party control. With EVM compatibility enabling modern governance tooling and DAO workflows,
        Ethereum Classic can now <strong>stand on its own — transparently funded, independent by design, and resilient
          against corporate capture or governance shortcuts</strong>.

            Activates EIP-1559-style fee mechanics and introduces the <code>BASEFEE</code> opcode (EIP-3198),
            improving EVM compatibility and fee predictability. On Ethereum Classic, the <code>BASEFEE</code>
            is <strong>not burned</strong>; instead, 100% is redirected at the consensus layer to the Olympia
            Treasury (ECIP-1112), while miner tips and block rewards remain unchanged.

            Olympia Treasury is governance-isolated and cannot be upgraded, modified, or accessed directly. Funds
            may only be released through the single authorized executor defined in ECIP-1113, using the
            hash-bound withdrawal semantics specified in ECIP-1114.

            Establishes Olympia DAO — a modular on-chain governance framework built around a Governor,
            Timelock, and Executor architecture that serves as the sole authorized path to the Treasury.
            ECIP-1113 defines the governance-execution pipeline but does not prescribe a specific voting
            module; voting systems are introduced separately through the OIP process and can evolve to meet
            the network’s needs without modifying consensus.

            Defines the Ethereum Classic Funding Proposal (ECFP) process — the exclusive, permissionless,
            hash-bound standard for Olympia Treasury spending. Each disbursement is tied to immutable,
            content-addressed metadata and follows a transparent lifecycle, using a deterministic tuple for

          <p>
            Defines an optional governance-layer mechanism for smoothing Treasury-held BASEFEE over time using a
            deterministic
            L-curve. Smoothing adjusts only the timing of governance-approved payouts — not their total amount — and
            requires
            explicit activation through the OIP process, with no changes to consensus rules. This provides ETC a flexible
            tool
            for shaping predictable security budgets as block rewards decline under ECIP-1017.

        Together, these ECIPs form the Olympia framework — a modular, upgrade-friendly funding layer that gives Ethereum
        Classic a reliable, transparent, and decentralized mechanism to sustain its ecosystem. Olympia keeps the consensus
        layer lightweight and secure: only minimal protocol changes are required (ECIP-1111), while all governance,
        proposal processing, and allocation logic operate in the contract layer where they can evolve safely over time.
        This architecture reflects best practices in modern blockchain protocol design and preserves Ethereum Classic’s
        core guarantees — <strong>no inflation, no custodians, and no changes to ECIP-1000 or the security of the base
          protocol</strong> — while enabling a flexible, extensible treasury system built for long-term sustainability.

    <!-- ABOUT ETC & OLYMPIA -->
    <section id="about">
      <h3>About Ethereum Classic &amp; Olympia</h3>
      <p>
        Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum chain, grounded in the <strong>Code is Law</strong> philosophy,
        Proof-of-Work security, and a long-standing commitment to immutability, neutrality, and open participation. ETC
        has historically chosen the harder path — preserving chain history and resisting governance shortcuts, even
        when that meant fewer resources and slower development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Olympia builds on these principles rather than replacing them. It introduces a transparent, on-chain funding
        layer for public goods, client maintenance, and ecosystem growth — while preserving ETC’s fixed monetary
        policy, Proof-of-Work consensus, and ECIP-1000-driven upgrade process. Olympia does not rewrite history, does
        not add inflation, and does not move protocol governance into a token-voting system; it simply ensures that
        Ethereum Classic can sustainably fund the work required to remain a secure, credible, and independent
        Proof-of-Work smart contract platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site provides a high-level overview of the Olympia ECIPs. The full, canonical specifications are published
        in the official Ethereum Classic ECIP repository and should be treated as the source of truth for implementers
        and auditors.
