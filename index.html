      <h2>Non-Inflationary Treasury &amp; On-Chain Funding Layer for ETC</h2>
      <p>
        Olympia is a set of Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIPs 1111–1115).
        Together they add modern EIP-1559-style fee mechanics and a protocol-native,
        non-inflationary treasury. This creates a transparent on-chain funding layer
        for public goods and ecosystem growth, while all protocol upgrades continue
        to follow Ethereum Classic’s existing ECIP-1000 governance process.

      <h3>Olympia Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Historically, Ethereum Classic has relied on outside donors, grants, and
        volunteer work to fund essential development. Olympia introduces a
        <strong>protocol-native, transparent, non-inflationary</strong> funding
        layer by adding <strong>BASEFEE</strong>—a protocol-level fee per unit of gas—
        through ECIP-1111 and redirecting that revenue into an immutable on-chain
        treasury.
      </p>
    
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h4><span>ECIP-1111</span> EVM &amp; Fee Market Upgrades</h4>
          <p>
            Adds modern EVM features and introduces BASEFEE, an automatic fee component
            similar to EIP-1559. Instead of burning BASEFEE like Ethereum, ETC redirects
            it to a destination chosen by consensus, enabling a protocol-level funding
            stream while keeping Proof-of-Work and fixed emission unchanged.

        <div class="card">
          <h4><span>ECIP-1112</span> Olympia Treasury Contract</h4>
          <p>
            Defines a permanent, protocol-controlled treasury that receives redirected
            BASEFEE. The contract is immutable, cannot mint ETC, and can only release
            funds through approved governance actions, making the funding process
            auditable and predictable.

        <div class="card">
          <h4><span>ECIP-1113</span> DAO Governance Framework</h4>
          <p>
            Establishes the modular governance system that authorizes treasury
            spending. It sets the rules for how proposals, voting modules, and
            execution work—without enforcing any specific voter identity or
            sybil-resistance model.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h4><span>ECIP-1114</span> Funding Proposal Process</h4>
          <p>
            Standardizes how funding proposals move from idea to executed payment.
            It defines required metadata, review steps, voting periods, and
            milestone-based payouts so that every request follows the same
            transparent, on-chain process.

        <div class="card">
          <h4><span>ECIP-1115</span> Miner Incentive Smoothing (Optional)</h4>
          <p>
            Adds an optional mechanism to smooth out BASEFEE revenue over time.
            This helps stabilize miner income during periods of fluctuating
            network usage and supports long-term security planning, without
            changing block rewards or emission.

      <p class="section-spacer">
        Together, these ECIPs create a modular system that gives Ethereum Classic
        a reliable and transparent way to fund its ecosystem—without inflation,
        without trusted custodians, and without changing ECIP-1000 or core
        consensus rules.

      <h3>About Ethereum Classic &amp; Olympia</h3>
      <p>
        Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum chain, grounded in the
        <strong>Code is Law</strong> philosophy, Proof-of-Work security, and a
        long-standing commitment to immutability, neutrality, and open participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Olympia builds on these principles without altering them. It introduces a
        transparent, on-chain funding layer for public goods, client maintenance,
        and ecosystem growth—while preserving ETC’s fixed monetary policy,
        consensus rules, and historical integrity. Olympia does not change chain
        history, does not add inflation, and does not replace the ECIP-1000
        process for protocol upgrades; it simply adds a sustainable way to fund
        the work that keeps the network healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site provides a high-level overview of the Olympia ECIPs. The full,
        canonical specifications are published in the official Ethereum Classic
        ECIP repository.
