        ECIPs 1111–1115 · From Research to Deployment
      </div>
      <h2>A Phased Path for the Olympia Upgrade</h2>
      <p>
        Olympia is a multi-ECIP upgrade for Ethereum Classic that must be developed, tested, and
        adopted carefully. This roadmap summarizes how the suite—ECIPs 1111 through 1115—moves from
        research and drafting to testnet deployment, community review, and potential mainnet
        activation.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        Exact dates and activation blocks are determined by the ECIP-1000 process and client
        readiness. The roadmap below is intentionally high-level and focuses on sequence and
        dependencies, not fixed timelines.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="phases">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-project"></i> High-Level Phases</h3>
      <p>
        The Olympia roadmap can be thought of in five major phases. Some phases overlap in time,
        but each has distinct goals and outputs.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h4>Phase 1 – Research &amp; Problem Definition</h4>
          <p>
            Community calls, historical analysis, and design discussions identify ETC’s funding,
            security, and governance challenges. Existing fee models, treasury ideas, and DAO
            patterns are evaluated against Ethereum Classic’s values.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Phase 2 – ECIP Drafting &amp; Review</h4>
          <p>
            ECIPs 1111–1115 are written as a modular suite: fee mechanics, treasury vault,
            governance framework, funding process, and optional smoothing. Drafts are refined
            through public review, GitHub feedback, and community calls.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Phase 3 – Testnet Implementations</h4>
          <p>
            Client and contract implementations are deployed on testnets (for example, Mordor).
            This phase validates consensus behavior, BASEFEE accounting, treasury logic, and DAO
            execution flows under real network conditions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Phase 4 – Community Review &amp; Consensus</h4>
          <p>
            Miners, node operators, developers, and ecosystem participants evaluate testnet
            results, discuss tradeoffs, and refine parameters. If broad consensus forms, ECIPs
            progress toward “Final” status per ECIP-1000.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Phase 5 – Mainnet Activation &amp; Iteration</h4>
          <p>
            If adopted, Olympia is activated in a scheduled network upgrade. After launch, the
            DAO, treasury, and smoothing model can be tuned via future ECIPs and Olympia
            Improvement Proposals (OIPs), based on live data and community feedback.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="callout section-spacer">
        <strong>Specification-Driven:</strong>
        At every phase, decisions are grounded in the written ECIPs, testnet behavior, and the
        ECIP-1000 process—not in private agreements or off-chain control.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="milestones">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-timeline"></i> Key Milestones &amp; Dependencies</h3>
      <p>
        Olympia’s components are modular but interdependent. Some pieces can move ahead of others,
        while certain milestones must happen in order.
      </p>

      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <h4>ECIP Suite Drafted (1111–1115)</h4>
          <span>Specification Complete · Subject to Ongoing Review</span>
          <p>
            All five ECIPs exist as drafts that can be read, discussed, and refined. This provides a
            complete picture of fees, treasury, governance, funding, and smoothing—even if not all
            pieces are activated at once.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <h4>Fee &amp; BASEFEE Implementation on Testnet (ECIP-1111)</h4>
          <span>Core Prerequisite for Treasury &amp; Smoothing</span>
          <p>
            EIP-1559-style BASEFEE accounting and type-2 transactions are implemented on a testnet.
            Clients are tested for correctness, performance, and compatibility with existing tooling.
          </p>

          <span>Vault Ready · BASEFEE Destination Hook</span>
          <p>
            The immutable treasury contract is deployed and wired to receive redirected BASEFEE on
            testnet. Explorers and dashboards begin tracking balances and flows.
          </p>

          <p>
            Governance contracts, timelocks, and proposal flows are tested. Proposals are created,
            voted on, queued, and executed against the treasury on testnet to validate the full
            pipeline from idea to payment.

          <p>
            The L-curve smoothing model is simulated and, if desired, deployed on testnet. Miners
            and researchers analyze its impact on revenue stability and security over time.

          <p>
            If testnet results are satisfactory, the community converges on whether and how to
            activate Olympia on mainnet. Client teams coordinate releases and activation blocks.
          </p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <h4>Mainnet Activation (Pending Consensus)</h4>
          <span>Network Upgrade · Ongoing Monitoring</span>
          <p>
            Olympia components agreed upon by the community are activated in a scheduled network
            upgrade. Post-activation, the system is closely monitored and future refinements are
            proposed through new ECIPs and OIPs.

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="callout section-spacer">
        <strong>Modular Dependencies:</strong>
        ECIP-1111 (fees) can, in principle, be adopted without the full treasury and DAO stack.
        ECIP-1112–1114 require 1111 to be meaningful. ECIP-1115 is optional and can be revisited
        independently as the network matures.

    <section id="participation">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i> How the Community Can Participate</h3>
      <p>
        Olympia is designed to emerge from open collaboration between developers, miners, node
        operators, businesses, and community members. There are several ways to engage with the
        roadmap and influence outcomes.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h4>Read &amp; Review the ECIPs</h4>
          <p>
            Start with the written specifications. Provide feedback via GitHub comments, issues, or
            public forums. Concrete, line-specific suggestions are especially valuable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Run Testnet Infrastructure</h4>
          <p>
            Node operators and miners can run testnet clients, help uncover issues, and contribute
            to performance and stability testing for ECIP-1111–1115.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Build Tools &amp; Dashboards</h4>
          <p>
            Explorers, analytics, and governance dashboards make it easier for everyone to
            understand how Olympia works in practice—especially the treasury and DAO flows.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Propose Governance Configurations</h4>
          <p>
            Future Olympia Improvement Proposals (OIPs) can specify voter sets, delegate systems,
            or Child-DAO structures. Community members can draft and advocate for these designs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Prepare Ecosystem Projects</h4>
          <p>
            Teams building clients, tools, dApps, or education programs can plan potential funding
            proposals under ECIP-1114, aligning their roadmaps with the Olympia treasury model.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Engage in Public Discussion</h4>
          <p>
            Community calls, forums, and social channels are where tradeoffs are debated and
            priorities are set. Clear, well-reasoned participation helps guide the roadmap
            toward outcomes that align with ETC’s core principles.

      </div>

      <div class="callout section-spacer">
        <strong>Participation, Not Permission:</strong>
        Olympia is architected so that anyone in the ETC ecosystem can contribute to research,
        testing, governance design, and proposal development. No single entity owns the roadmap.
