      <h2>A Cohesive Upgrade for Fees, Treasury, and Governance</h2>
      <p>
        Olympia is a modular upgrade suite for Ethereum Classic that connects modern fee mechanics,
        a protocol-native treasury, and on-chain governance into one coherent system. It is composed
        of five Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIPs)—<strong>1111 through 1115</strong>—
        that can be adopted together or in stages, without changing ETC’s fixed emission or
        Proof-of-Work consensus.
      </p>

        This page tells the high-level upgrade story. The subpages linked below go deeper into fees,
        the treasury contract, governance design, expected ecosystem impact, and long-term vision.

      <p>
        The Olympia ECIPs are designed to be <strong>modular but complementary</strong>. Each proposal
        focuses on one part of the system, and together they form a complete pathway from no protocol
        funding to a <strong>transparent, on-chain treasury and DAO</strong>.

          <h4><span>ECIP–1111</span> Olympia EVM &amp; Protocol Upgrades</h4>
          <p>
            Introduces <strong>EIP-1559-style BASEFEE accounting</strong>, type-2 transactions, and
            related EVM compatibility improvements. BASEFEE is a protocol-set minimum fee per unit of gas.
            Instead of burning BASEFEE as Ethereum does, ETC redirects it to a consensus-selected
            destination, enabling protocol-native funding without inflation.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Modernizes ETC’s fee market and transaction types.</li>
            <li>Improves compatibility with contemporary EVM tooling and wallets.</li>
            <li>Preserves Proof-of-Work and fixed monetary policy.</li>
            <li>Provides the plumbing for BASEFEE redirection (for example, to the Olympia Treasury).</li>

          <h4><span>ECIP–1112</span> Olympia Treasury Contract</h4>
          <p>
            Defines a <strong>protocol-controlled, immutable treasury smart contract</strong> that
            can receive BASEFEE and disburse funds only via standardized governance calls.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>No upgrade keys, no backdoors, no minting functions.</li>
            <li>Designed purely as a vault for protocol revenue.</li>
            <li>All movements of funds are transparent and auditable on-chain.</li>

          <h4><span>ECIP–1113</span> Olympia DAO Governance Framework</h4>
          <p>
            Specifies a <strong>modular DAO architecture</strong> that governs how the treasury
            authorizes disbursements. It separates core protocol funding capabilities from social
            choices around identity, delegation, and participation.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Defines roles, modules, and execution timelocks.</li>
            <li>Supports Child-DAOs and specialized funding streams.</li>

            Standardizes the <strong>lifecycle of funding proposals</strong>—from submission and
            review to voting and milestone-based execution.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Defines proposal states, required metadata, and execution rules.</li>

          <h4><span>ECIP–1115</span> Miner Incentive Smoothing (Optional)</h4>
          <p>
            Introduces an <strong>optional smoothing mechanism</strong> that redistributes BASEFEE
            over time, following a modeled “L-curve” to support a more predictable long-term
            security budget.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Helps miners plan around variable fee revenue.</li>
            <li>Is explicitly optional and can be enabled or omitted by consensus.</li>
            <li>Works alongside 1111–1114 without changing their core guarantees.</li>

        <strong>Modular by Design:</strong>
        1111 can be adopted on its own to modernize fees and redirect BASEFEE.
        1112–1114 add a treasury and governance layer. 1115 is optional and can be
        revisited independently as the network matures.

    <section id="principles">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced"></i> Design Principles</h3>
      <p>
        Olympia is intentionally aligned with Ethereum Classic’s long-standing philosophy.
        Each ECIP is written to respect a small set of non-negotiable constraints:
      </p>
      <div class="pill-row">
        <span class="pill">No monetary inflation</span>
        <span class="pill">Proof-of-Work preserved</span>
        <span class="pill">Immutability &amp; “Code is Law”</span>
        <span class="pill">Transparent on-chain funding</span>
        <span class="pill">Modular governance</span>
        <span class="pill">Client diversity &amp; compatibility</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Instead of introducing a new “governance coin” or routing decisions through a single
        foundation, Olympia:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses <strong>existing protocol revenue (BASEFEE)</strong> instead of new issuance.</li>
        <li>Keeps the <strong>treasury contract immutable</strong> while allowing governance modules to evolve.</li>
        <li>Separates <strong>capabilities</strong> (what the protocol can do) from
          <strong>social choices</strong> (who participates and how).</li>
        <li>Maintains <strong>EVM compatibility</strong> by adopting 1559-style accounting without burning.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Questions like “Who gets to vote?”, “How are delegates chosen?”, or “Which identity system
        should be used?” are deliberately pushed to the <strong>social layer</strong> and to future
        Olympia Improvement Proposals (OIPs), not enshrined in the base protocol.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="deployment">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-road"></i> Deployment Path &amp; Phasing</h3>
      <p>
        Olympia follows the existing <strong>ECIP-1000</strong> process, which is Ethereum Classic’s
        standard path for network upgrades. It is expected to roll out in phases, with careful testing
        and community review at each step.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Research &amp; Historical Context</strong><br />
          Years of ETC community calls and research (2021–2024) documented long-term funding
          challenges, client fragility, and the need for a protocol-native, non-inflationary
          treasury mechanism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ECIP Drafting</strong><br />
          ECIPs 1111–1115 are drafted as a tightly scoped, modular suite, each with a single,
          well-defined responsibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Testnet Implementations</strong><br />
          Client and contract implementations are deployed on testnets (such as Mordor) to validate
          behavior, assumptions, and operator experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community Review &amp; Refinement</strong><br />
          Miners, node operators, developers, and ecosystem participants review the behavior,
          discuss tradeoffs, and suggest refinements via ECIP discussions and open calls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mainnet Activation (Pending Consensus)</strong><br />
          If broad consensus forms, Olympia is scheduled for a future network upgrade through the
          established ETC governance process.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Specification-Driven Review:</strong>
        Decisions about Olympia are made through the ECIP-1000 process, with feedback grounded in
        the written specifications and observed behavior on testnets, rather than personal preference
        or off-chain influence.
