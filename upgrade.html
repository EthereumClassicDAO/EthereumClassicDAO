      <h3>Olympia: The Funding Layer for Ethereum Classic</h3>
      
      <p>
        Olympia is the upgrade that gives Ethereum Classic a sustainable, protocol-native funding layer.
        It unifies modern fee mechanics, an immutable Treasury, and on-chain governance into a coherent,
        transparent system. Defined across <strong>ECIPs 1111 through 1115</strong>, Olympia introduces
        these capabilities without changing ETC’s fixed monetary policy, miner incentives, or Proof-of-Work
        consensus.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        Olympia defines how BASEFEE accounting, a non-inflationary Treasury, and an on-chain governance
        and funding process work together at the protocol and contract layers. It is designed for the people
        who rely on the network—miners, developers, node operators, and ecosystem builders—by providing a
        transparent, accountable way to sustain clients, infrastructure, and public goods without depending
        on centralized donors or off-chain sponsors. As of November 11, 2025 (“Olympia Day”), Ethereum Classic
        core developers have moved from the ECIP drafting phase into reference implementation, integrating
        the consensus-layer components of <strong>ECIP-1111</strong> into <strong>Fukuii</strong>, a modern,
        Scala-based ETC client derived from Mantis. Fukuii is maintained independently of the Ethereum
        Foundation’s Proof-of-Stake roadmap, giving Ethereum Classic a native, long-term client path for
        validating and deploying Olympia on testnets and, ultimately, mainnet.

      <p>
        The Olympia ECIPs are designed to be <strong>modular but complementary</strong>. Each proposal
        focuses on one part of the system, and together they form a complete pathway from no protocol
        funding to a <strong>transparent, on-chain treasury and DAO</strong>.

          <p>
            Introduces <strong>EIP-1559-style fee mechanics</strong> and the <code>BASEFEE</code> opcode
            (<strong>EIP-3198</strong>) on Ethereum Classic. BASEFEE becomes a protocol-set minimum fee per
            unit of gas. On ETC, unlike Ethereum mainnet, <strong>100% of BASEFEE is redirected</strong>
            at the consensus layer to the Olympia Treasury (ECIP-1112) instead of being burned.

    <!-- DESIGN PRINCIPLES -->
    <section id="principles">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced"></i> Design Principles</h3>
      <p>
        Olympia is intentionally aligned with Ethereum Classic’s long-standing philosophy.
        Each ECIP is written to respect a small set of non-negotiable constraints:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No monetary inflation or new governance token required.</li>
        <li>Proof-of-Work consensus and chain history are preserved.</li>
        <li>Immutability and the <strong>Code is Law</strong> ethos remain intact.</li>
        <li>Funding flows are transparent, on-chain, and auditable.</li>
        <li>Governance is modular and upgradeable at the contract layer.</li>
        <li>EVM compatibility and client diversity are treated as first-class goals.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Instead of introducing a new “governance coin” or routing decisions through a single
        foundation, Olympia:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses <strong>existing protocol revenue (BASEFEE)</strong> instead of new issuance.</li>
        <li>Keeps the <strong>Treasury contract immutable</strong> while allowing governance modules to evolve.</li>
        <li>Separates <strong>capabilities</strong> (what the protocol can do) from
          <strong>social choices</strong> (who participates and how).</li>
        <li>Maintains <strong>EVM compatibility</strong> by adopting 1559-style accounting without burning.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Questions like “Who gets to vote?”, “How are delegates chosen?”, or “Which identity system
        should be used?” are deliberately pushed to the <strong>social layer</strong> and to future
        Olympia Improvement Proposals (OIPs), not enshrined in the base protocol.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- DEPLOYMENT PATH -->
    <section id="deployment">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-road"></i> Deployment Path &amp; Phasing</h3>
      <p>
        Olympia follows the existing <strong>ECIP-1000</strong> process, Ethereum Classic’s standard
        path for network upgrades. It is expected to roll out in phases, with careful testing and
        community review at each step. As of November 11, 2025 (“Olympia Day”), the project has moved
        from the ECIP drafting phase into reference implementation, with the consensus-layer changes
        of ECIP-1111 under active development in the Fukuii client.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Research &amp; Historical Context</strong><br />
          Years of ETC community calls and research documented long-term funding challenges,
          client fragility, and the need for a protocol-native, non-inflationary Treasury mechanism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ECIP Drafting</strong><br />
          ECIPs 1111–1115 are drafted as a tightly scoped, modular suite, each with a single,
          well-defined responsibility and clear interfaces to the others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Testnet Implementations</strong><br />
          Client and contract implementations are deployed on testnets (such as Mordor) to validate
          behavior, economic assumptions, and operator experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community Review &amp; Refinement</strong><br />
          Miners, node operators, developers, and ecosystem participants review the behavior,
          discuss tradeoffs, and suggest refinements via ECIP discussions and open calls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mainnet Activation (Pending Consensus)</strong><br />
          If broad consensus forms, Olympia is scheduled for a future network upgrade through the
          established ECIP-1000 governance process.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Specification-Driven Review:</strong>
        Decisions about Olympia are made through the ECIP-1000 process, with feedback grounded in
        the written specifications and observed behavior on testnets, rather than personal preference
        or off-chain influence.
